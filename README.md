# Vite SSR Starter
Quickly build full-stack webapps with SSR using vitejs. This is a completely opinionated repo which I built for my own purposes.
It is built using following stack for linting, formatting, type-checking, authentication:

1. vite-plugin-ssr
2. reactjs 
3. typescript
4. eslint 
5. prettier  
6. husky
7. commit-lint
8. chakra-ui
9. next-auth


## Usage

1. ```git clone https://github.com/s-kris/vite-ssr-starter```
2. Configure ```./server/auth/next.ts``` as mentioned [here](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options).
3. ```yarn install```
4. ```yarn dev```


## Todo
1. Add a testing framework
